TODO
----

* Fixup WHO
* Implement privileges
* MODE validation, MODE params (we're going to end up with a MODE object...)
* Fix NICK/auth
* Add multiple targets
* Check for bans and *lines
* Use IRCd::Constants

Specific handlers:
----------------
NICK:
-> Add validation for characters

QUIT:
-> Filter QUIT msg (????)
-> 0 param ok, or 1. nothing else.

JOIN:
-> "JOIN 0" needs to be implemented

WHO:
-> Lots of parameters to implement

Bit further ahead (in relative time):
----
* Multiple sock providers
* SSL/TLS
