TODO
----

* Implement privileges
* MODE validation
* Fix NICK/auth
* Max lengths for PART/QUIT etc (all commands?)
* Max lengths packets
* Add multiple targets (done for JOIN)
* Check for bans and *lines
* Add name resolution
* Logging
* Make sure that we tell people when they JOIN an already used room
* Ensure everything's errorified (especially before commits, if we can)
* Are QUITs being announced properly?
* Have a hash for parameters to Modes because it's a mess otherwise
* Let's have a IRCd::Socket wrapper for the write and (recv) functions...
* Make argmodes in MODE configurable/dynamic
* Logging
* TOPIC
* RPL_ISUPPORT

Specific handlers:
----------------
NICK:
-> Add validation for characters

QUIT:
-> 0 param ok, or 1. nothing else.

JOIN:
-> "JOIN 0" needs to be implemented

WHO:
-> Lots of parameters to implement

Bit further ahead (in relative time):
----
* Multiple sock providers
-> http://search.cpan.org/~pevans/IO-Async-0.70/lib/IO/Async.pm#SEE_ALSO
* SSL/TLS
* TS6 and other link protocols? (TS6 first?)
